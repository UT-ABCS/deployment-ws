This project was taught as a Technical Project Workshop for the Association of Computer Scientists at the University of Texas at Austin. This project is complete, though small changes may be added in the future. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/UT-ABCS/tech-workshops).  <br />

This workshop will cover how to deploy a website (for free). The goal is to deploy a static website to different hosts in order to see various different ways we can go about deployment. We wonâ€™t be coding during this workshop! You can find the slides associated with this workshop at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N7cFbt2-T3PYe4gc8xmnvTcGUKheM9lI_NM1_ut-uaw/edit).  <br />
